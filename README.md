# Introduction 

DS3231 RTC(Real Time Clock) sensro which shows the time and date, by connecting it to a Raspberry Pi which was done by hand solderable 
design meant to be compatible with the devices in the Humber Parts Crib which require more skills and techniques to assemble.
It has a bidirectional LED and three I2C device sockets. The bidirectional LED allows the hardware equivalent of "Hello World"
to be achieved by blinking the LED. I2C is a very common hardware peripheral bus and is designed to have an analog breakout
board, a Real Time Clock module, and an integrated environmental sensor module connected. It takes most individuals about a
week of effort to complete these build instructions directed towards technologically inclined students especially given other
commitments. Be aware that the image creation steps take at least 3 hours alone.




Ds3231 rtc is senser which shows time and date, which will be connecting to a raspberry Pi using a PCB design with following connecting :

| Ds3231 | Raspberry Pi |
| --- | --- |
| GND | P1-06 |
| Vcc | P1-01(3.3V) |
| SDA | P1-03(I2C SDA) |
| SCL | 1-05(I2C SCL) |

# Bill of Materials/Budget

The materials that I used in my project, most of it I used but there are some materials I did not, also all the products that I bought was from Amazon,it took about one day to be shipped. Starting with the first product which was the raspberry pi, it cost me about $69.99+Tax. the second and the thir item were LCD Display Module it cost about $12.28+Tax, and Lithium battery which was about $8.19+Tax  I did not need to used these items in my project. The fourth item was the Ds3231 RTC the price of it $9.99+Tax,For the tools that I already have was the tool kit which include the jumper wires, Female-to-male Dupont wire and solderless wire and that cost me about $23.99+Tax. In total the price that I used in project without the two items was about $117.49 including Tax.Link to the whole budget[budget](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/budget%20.docx).

# Time Commitment

I had touble in getting some part of the project to be done. 



# Mechanical Assembly

# PCB / Soldering

The PCB desing of my project, I was using Fritzing which help me to do the desing for my cirucit
