In today's lab I was able to do my solderering for my parts. I'm on track with my [project schedule](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/Rula%20Schedule.docx), which I have done until this week. According to my [project proposal](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/RULAPR.xlsx),I was able to solderer the the sockt and the headers in the PCD board.Also, For the financial status I was able to stick to my budget that I have, and I didnt need to buy any extra parts for my project
