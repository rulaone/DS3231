Today I'm going to present my project [Presentation%20Ds3231%20RTC](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/Presentation%20Ds3231%20RTC.pptx)

I was able to finish the case and fix all the measurment that I had. It took me about two days to figure out how to fix it, the corel Draw case [Rula%2016](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/Rula%2016.cdr) shows from the [top](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/top.JPG) [back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/back.JPG) [right](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/right.JPG) and [left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/left.JPG).I'm now on track with my schedule [project schedule](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/Rula%20Schedule.docx). For my [project proposal](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/RULAPR.xlsx), was able to get the point that I need which is show time and date.

In today's lab I was not able to finish my case.I'm littel bit late on my [project schedule](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/Rula%20Schedule.docx), beacuse I had a problem with the measuring of my case. According to my [project proposal](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/RULAPR.xlsx),I was able to finish it in the same day.

In today's lab I was able to connet to the ds3231 rtc from the raspberry pi and show the current time and date.I'm on track with my [project schedule](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/Rula%20Schedule.docx), which I have done from the previous weeks. According to my [project proposal](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/RULAPR.xlsx),I was able to read from ds 3231 which was showing the time and the date of our time.For the financial status I was able to stick to my budget that I have, and I didnt need to buy any extra parts for my project [DS3231connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/DS3231connection.PNG)

 In today's lab I was able to do my solderering for my parts. I'm on track with my [project schedule](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/documentation/Rula%20Schedule.docx), which I have done until this week. According to my [project proposal](https://github.com/rulaone/DS3231/blob/master/RULAPR.xlsx),I was able to solderer the the sockt and the headers in 
 the PCD board.Also, For the financial status I was able to stick to my budget that I have, and I didnt need to buy any extra parts for 
 my project [IMG_5353](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/IMG_5353.JPG)

In that day I was not able to attend the lab, but I was able to do the fritzing for my circuit [Fritzing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/Fritzing.PNG)

project activities, according to my schedule that I made is I'm on schedule. I able to understand how i connect my scensor to my 
raspberry pi, since ds 3231 has two types which one is for the raspberry pi[ds%20rasp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/ds%20rasp.jpg) and [ds%20ard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/ds%20ard.jpg)and the second one is this for arduino,so I chooes the ds3231 
arduino. So I can have it connected to the bradboard.My progress is meeting with proposal which I had. I was able to connect from the ds 
3231 to the raspberry pi.[IMG_5273](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rulaone/DS3231/master/IMG_5273.JPG).problems/opportunities,I had 
one problem which i had to remove the resistor in the ds 3231 rtc.Financial updates, No, I was able to get my cirucit working.
